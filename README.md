# Titanic: The Power of PredictionðŸ”¥

## Overview
This project focuses on the Titanic machine learning competition hosted on Kaggle. The goal is to predict the survival of passengers based on various features using different machine learning models.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of information about the passengers aboard the Titanic, including:
- **Pclass**: Passenger class
- **Name**: Name of the passenger
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger
- **Age**: Age of the passenger
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard
- **Ticket**: Ticket number
- **Fare**: Ticket fare
- **Cabin**: Cabin number
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)

## Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Created new features and scaled numerical variables for better model performance.
3. **Modeling**: Implemented various machine learning models, including:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree Classifier
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
   - Gaussian Naive Bayes
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Gradient Boosting Classifier

## Results
- The highest accuracy achieved was **86%** using the Random Forest Classifier.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the importance of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection in achieving high prediction accuracy in machine learning tasks.
